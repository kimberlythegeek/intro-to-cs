### Paying Off Credit Card Debt

#### Problem 1: 
Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the
minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month. 

#### Problem 2: 
Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay
off a credit card balance within 12 months. We will not be dealing with a minimum monthly
payment rate. 

#### Problem 3: 
Write a program that uses these bounds and bisection search (for more info check out the
Wikipedia page here) to find the smallest monthly payment to the cent (no more multiples of
$10) such that we can pay off the debt within a year. Try it out with large inputs, and notice how
fast it is. Produce the output in the same format as you did in problem 2.

## Part 1

### Successive Approximation

#### Problem 1:
Implement the `evaluate_poly` function. This function evaluates a polynomial function for the
given x value. It takes in a tuple of numbers poly and a number x. By number, we mean
that x and each element of poly is a float. `evaluate_poly` takes the polynomial represented
by poly and computes its value at x. It returns this value as a float.
